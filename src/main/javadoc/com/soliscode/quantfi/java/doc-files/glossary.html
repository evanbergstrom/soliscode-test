    <strong><a id="in_the_money">In-The-Money</a></strong>
    An in-the-money option is an option contract that has intrinsic value. It
    means that the option's strike price (the predetermined price at which the
    underlying asset can be bought or sold) is favorable compared to the current
    market price of the underlying asset. For call options, an in-the-money
    option has a strike price below the market price of the underlying asset,
    while for put options, the strike price is above the market price. In both
    cases, exercising the option would result in a profit if done immediately.

    <strong><a id="out_of_the_money">In-The-Money</a></strong>
    An out-of-the-money option is an option contract that currently has no
    intrinsic value. It means that the option's strike price is not favorable
    compared to the current market price of the underlying asset. For call options,
    an out-of-the-money option has a strike price above the market price of the
    underlying asset, while for put options, the strike price is below the market
    price. If the option is out of the money at expiration, it would not be
    profitable to exercise the option. However, out-of-the-money options can still
    have time value and speculative value, depending on various factors such as the
    time remaining until expiration and market expectations.
